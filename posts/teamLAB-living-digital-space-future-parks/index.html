    Japanese art group 
    <a href="http://www.team-lab.net/">teamLAB</a>
     wants to change the way that Americans perceive space. Their 
    <a href="http://exhibition.team-lab.net/siliconvalley/">show of digital installation art</a>
     currently on view at Pace Gallery in Menlo Park, California is worth seeing for its tireless and inventive investigation of alternative modes of spatial recognition. There are 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection">many ways of representing the globe of the Earth in two dimensions</a>
    , and no single projection can capture the whole truth. Yet, when it comes to flattening the three-dimensional world of our everyday experience, linear perspective reigns supreme over spatial realism in Western popular visual culture.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    teamLAB argues that there is a distinctively Japanese approach to representing space, which the group calls 
    <a href="https://www.team-lab.net/concept/chou_shukan_kukan/">Ultra Subjective Space</a>
    . teamLAB developed the idea of Ultra Subjective Space through a process of retrospective abstraction, studying and reproducing the artworks of pre-modern Japan in order to uncover their hidden logic. The resulting system embraces the spatial qualities that distinguish classical Japanese and Western visual art. Never precisely defined, Ultra Subjective Space is explained in terms of where it came from, how it operates, and what it is not. According to teamLAB, this space blurs the lines between viewer and artwork, subject and object, and allows the viewer to “enter and move around freely within the [depicted] space.” Concretely, Ultra Subjective Space is often characterized by the use of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_projection">parallel projection</a>
     and spatial simultaneity - but it should not be confused with the simple application of these techniques. Ultra Subjective Space is a comprehensive ideology of visual representation distinct from the beliefs and practices of Western realist art.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>This ideology serves a utopian social agenda. Toshiyuki Inoko, the founder of teamLAB, mused in a 2013 interview: “What if a visual approach different from Western spatial recognition took root and became the norm? If all of mankind were looking at the world in that spatial manner [of Ultra Subjective Space], before long the boundaries between man and his environment would stop making sense, and we might create a new kind of society and culture.” Spatial recognition is a reflexive habit, an automatic and unconscious part of our mental processing. Familiarity blinds us to its pervasive presence and makes it hard for us to adopt or even imagine alternatives. The subliminal nature of spatial recognition is key to the promise and the daunting difficulty of teamLAB’s utopian vision. The mission of Living Digital Space and Future Parks, then, is to make Ultra Subjective Space intelligible, palatable, and even natural.</p>

  <p>Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 advocates for Ultra Subjective Space by demonstrating its compatibility with the three-dimensional space of our lived experience. Modeled after paintings like the 17th century rakuchū rakugai zu (Scenes in and around the Capital), and Tale of Genji, Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 is unmistakably Japanese. As such, it exemplifies and defines Ultra Subjective Space. The images of Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 are created by animating a 3D model. As the camera orbits through the depicted space, the landscape changes smoothly, reassuring the viewer that this space, though it appears flat, has volume and depth enough to accommodate movement and multiple points of view. The animated images in Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 play on repeat, and shortly into each loop, the surface of the image begins to flake away to reveal a skeletal wireframe underneath. Drawn in the style of an engineering blueprint, this wireframe dramatizes the technological nature of the 3D digital model used to create the image. The wireframe is an abstracted representation of the world which is legible to Western viewers. Itt mediates between Japanese and Western forms of spatial recognition and lends the Japanese approach an aura of scientific credibility.</p>

  <p>For me, Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 conveys the mechanics of Ultra Subjective Space without evoking its utopian effects. teamLAB argue that images using Ultra Subjective Space bring the viewer into harmony with nature by dissolving the boundaries between experiential and depicted space; they write that, looking at Ultra Subjective Space, “a viewer can pretend to enter and move around freely within the space of the painting.” Yet, for me, entering the space of Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 is a struggle. I am still in thrall to linear perspective, and imagining myself convincingly in a scene means seeing it in perspective. I can easily paste myself like a paper doll onto the surface of Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12, but actually placing myself within the image requires an imaginative twist to warp isotropic space into linear perspective around my avatar. I find the image intelligible but inhospitable.</p>
  
  
  <p>Recent findings from cultural psychology offer a means of reconciling my experience of Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 with teamLAB’s claims about Ultra Subjective Space. Psychologists Sean Duffy, Shinobu Kitayama, and Hazel Markus observe distinct “Eastern” and “Western” styles of visual perception and propose that they are anchored in different conceptions of the self. In the West, “the normative imperative…is to become independent from others and to discover and express one’s own unique attributes,” while in the East, “responsiveness to the concerns of social others, as well as the expectations of others, forms the basis for action.” Simply by living in a particular culture, people acquire skills, values, and behaviors which tend to reinforce the culturally dominant mode of being. Duffy, Kitayama, and Markus argue that visual perception is one such culturally contingent skill.</p>
  
  
  <p>Visual perception reflects the different conceptions of the self through complementary strategies of focused and dispersed visual attention. Duffy and Kitayama write that, “in the focused attention strategy, individual objects and their focal features receive the vast majority of the cognitive resources of attention,” while in the dispersed attention strategy, “objects surrounding the attended object, or features of the object’s context receive considerable attention, at the cost of focal information about the individual objects.” Using controlled experiments like the framed line test, Kitayama et. al. have shown that Japanese subjects excel at tasks requiring dispersed attention, while American subjects perform better on tasks requiring focused attention.</p>
  
  
  <p>These strategies of visual attention could explain why it was hard for me to imagine myself in the depicted space of Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12. Entering an image requires mentally reconstructing the depicted space based on the the visual features of the image. Despite teamLAB’s claims to the contrary, Western viewers do imagine themselves within perspective images. In linear perspective, recession into the distance is indicated by object size, which is an intrinsic property of objects. In parallel projection, which is characteristic of Ultra Subjective Space, objects climb upwards in the picture plane as they recede without diminishing in size. A 2006 study of facial recognition found that North American subjects were more sensitive to the intrinsic properties of facial features and Japanese subjects to overall facial configuration. Perhaps linear perspective feels natural to Western viewers because distance is encoded in intrinsic properties of objects, which rewards focused attention, while in Ultra Subjective Space, distance is encoded in the overall configuration of objects, which demands dispersed attention.</p>
  
  
  <p>Beyond this suggestive analogy between spatial and facial recognition, the construction of images in linear perspective and Ultra Subjective Space presupposes different conceptions of the self. Linear perspectives are calculated to reproduce the world faithfully from a single vantage point; this is dramatized by one of the earliest perspective images, a 15th century painting of the Florentine Baptistry by Filippo Brunelleschi. Brunelleschi had viewers place their heads into a hood which cut off peripheral vision so that the painting could only be seen through a single pinhole. From the beginning, linear perspective has demanded an autonomous, individual viewer: an independent self. By contrast, parallel projection can be understood as a sort of Riemannian sum of perspectival views from infinitely many vantage points. The practice of showing the same place simultaneously at many different points in time, as in Flowers and Corpse Glitch Set of 12, further expands the number of viewpoints in Ultra Subjective Space. Feeling at ease with such an image requires a self capable of integrating these many viewpoints. Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 is hard for me to enter and experience fully because it presumes an unfamiliar conception of the self and demands unaccustomed habits of visual attention.</p>
  
  
  <p>Sketch Town allows Western viewers to enter and experience Ultra Subjective Space more fully than Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12 by providing a concrete means of externalizing the adoption of a new way of seeing. Participants in Sketch Town are invited to color in the outlines of familiar objects - fire trucks, houses, airplanes, UFOs - and then scan the crayon drawings. With the drawing scanned, participants turn eagerly to a projected landscape which fills one wall, waiting for their creations to appear. Each crayon drawing is by itself spatially neutral; each airplane or car or truck could equally have been cut out of a linear perspective or an Ultra Subjective Space. Yet it is natural for Western viewers to imagine their object as belonging to a linear perspective image. When the drawing appears in the Ultra Subjective Space of the projected landscape, the viewer is forced to reconcile the assumption of perspective with the reality of Ultra Subjective Space. Sketch Town works because people are attached to their own drawings; rather than abandon their creations in the unfamiliar territory of Ultra Subjective Space, viewers modify their visual expectations to accommodate it.</p>

  <p>High on an adjacent wall, a small perspective projection of the Sketch Town landscape highlights the strengths of the Ultra Subjective Space and helps make viewers conscious of their spatial habituation. This perspective projection draws on another familiar Western precedent - not the Renaissance painting, but the first-person shooter video game. Unlike a first-person shooter, however, there’s no way to control the vantage point. As the camera drifts through the scene, a glance at the Ultra Subjective Space representation underscores the limitations of this first-person view from which only a tiny fraction of the landscape is visible at a time, subject to the caprices of the camera’s motion. In the Ultra Subjective Space view, by contrast, it is possible to grasp relationships and to see that each entity has a well-defined role to play: UFOs move cars around, fire trucks extinguish burning buildings, and airplanes fight monsters. The juxtaposition of spatial modes in Sketch Town is an effective reminder that spatial recognition is acquired, and that there are alternatives.</p>
  
  
  <p>All of teamLAB’s careful work to explain and evoke Ultra Subjective Space comes together in my favorite piece, an immersive video installation called Crows are Chased and the Chasing Crows are Destined to be Chased as Well, Division in Perspective – Light in Dark. This piece is less didactic, more lighthearted and more eclectic than either Sketch Town or Flowers &amp; Corpse Glitch Set of 12, and I feel a visceral response. Each time I stand in the middle of the dark room and experience the film, I am stirred. The careening, twisting motion of the watercolor crows impels me to move my body. When I’m alone, I dance hesitantly, for the sheer joy of it, and in the iridescent darkness, I feel graceful.</p>

  <p>Crows are Chased is powerful because of the way that it uses projection surfaces to convey a sense of space. One long wall serves as the main projection surface. This wall is partially obscured by freestanding walls on either side of the room which show fragments of the scene on the long wall behind, progressively magnified. By interleaving the projections with the inhabitable space of the gallery using these freestanding walls, teamLAB gives the film a powerful three-dimensional quality. For a viewer standing at the back of the gallery, the rows of freestanding walls suggest a vanishing point at the center of the long wall, and the exaggerated size of the closer images creates a forced perspective which amplify the impression of depth. The camerawork is masterful as well; the camera swings and swoops as if it is yet another crow, chased and chasing. As flowers and crows spin from one panel to the next, they shrink in lurches and then grow large again, so that the forced perspective also exaggerates the whirling movement in the film. The floor, polished to a glossy black obsidian, reflects these swooping animated figures in hazy washes of color which fill the peripheral vision. The result is neither linear perspective, nor Ultra Subjective Space, but some synthesis of the two.</p>
  
  
  <p>I leave Pace Gallery with a headache from the bright lights and strange odors and emerge blinking into a sunlit world of linear perspective. teamLAB’s artworks haven’t fundamentally changed the way that I see the world. Perhaps this is no surprise if we are to understand these modes of spatial recognition as manifestations of total cultures. Psychologist J. J. Gibson wrote in 1960: “Human visual perception is learned, but not in the same way that we learn a language…What the artist can do is not to create a new kind of vision, but to educate our attention.” I left Pace Gallery not with a new kind of vision, but with a new awareness that mine was one among many ways of seeing the world.</p>
